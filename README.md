## Eat-Da-Burger! Burger tracking app

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and maintain a log of burgers that have been eaten.

## Installation
The user can access the application via the Heroku link here:

https://gentle-cliffs-68887.herokuapp.com/

Alternatively, the user can fork the repository, install the necessary dependencies by running the npm i command via the user's command line, and changing the details to the user's details in the connection.js file in the config directory.

Note, the user will need to setup the DB by running the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files into the mysql server from the command line and then run these files via the MySQL command line tool prior to initialising the application.

## Usage
The application is simple to use - we would encourage anyone experiencing difficulty to get in touch.

## Credits
The design and content of the application is derived from a review of material provided by Trilogy Education Service in Unit 13, in particular, the solution provided for activity 17 (CatsApp).
